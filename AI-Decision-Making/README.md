* To run unit tests: put test homework1.py and data.pck in the directory containing homework1.py. From the shell, run "```bash python -m pytest -v```" in the directory containing your homework1.py<br>
* Questions 1 and 3 involve randomness. Every time you run your code, you will get a different answer. You should ensure your answers are accurate enough to consistently pass the unit tests.
* Do not look at anyone elseâ€™s code.<br>
* The only modules your code can import are: numpy, random<br>
